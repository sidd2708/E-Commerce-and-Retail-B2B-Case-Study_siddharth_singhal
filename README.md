## Overview
### Schuster, a multinational retail company specializing in sports goods and accessories, operates under credit arrangements with hundreds of vendors. However, not all vendors adhere to the agreed credit terms, resulting in late payments. While Schuster imposes late payment fees as a deterrent, this approach is not sustainable for long-term business relationships. Additionally, the manual efforts of employees chasing vendors for on-time payments lead to inefficiencies, non-value-added activities, and financial strain.

### To address these challenges, Schuster aims to understand customer payment behavior and predict the likelihood of delayed payments for open invoices.

## Current Payment Process
### Invoice Generation:

#### After every transaction with a vendor, the accounting team generates an invoice.
#### The invoice includes details such as goods description, invoice value, creation date, and payment due date (based on credit terms).
### Frequent Transactions:

#### Schuster maintains frequent business with its vendors, leading to multiple invoices for each vendor at any given time.

## Business Objective
### Segment customers based on their payment behavior to gain deeper insights.
### Leverage historical data to predict delayed payments for transactions with pending due dates in a new dataset.
### Utilize these predictions to optimize resource allocation, accelerate credit recovery, and minimize non-value-adding activities.

## Key Questions Addressed
### How can we analyze customer transaction data to identify different payment behaviors?
### How can customers be segmented based on their historical payment patterns?
### Can we predict the likelihood of delayed payments for open invoices using historical data?
### What actionable business insights can be drawn from the developed models?
